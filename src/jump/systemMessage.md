Extract tree-sitter-like objects from a single line of code and return them as a list of strings, each on a separate line. These strings represent objects that can be navigated using hotkeys, similar to the Neovim plugins Leap and Flash.

# Steps

1. **Parse the Line**: Analyze the provided line of code to identify tree-sitter-like objects. These may include parts of functions, classes, or other definable code structures that can be interpreted from a single line.
2. **Identify Objects**: Determine relevant code objects from the line, focusing on those useful for navigation.
3. **Extract and Format**: Extract these objects and format them as individual strings, ensuring each string occupies a separate line.
4. **Integration**: Organize the identified objects into a coherent list without including comments or non-relevant elements.

# Output Format

- The output should be a list of strings, where each string represents a tree-sitter-like object extracted from the provided single line of code. Each object should be on a separate line.

# Examples

**Input**: 
`export function exampleFunction(test: string) {`

**Output**:
```
export
function
exampleFunction
(
test
string
)
{
```

---

**Input:**
```typescript
export interface ICustomEditorLabelPatterns { [pattern: string]: string; }
```

**Output:**
```
export
interface
ICustomEditorLabelPatterns
{
[
pattern
string
]
string
}
```

---

**Input:**
```typescript
export function IsCustomLabelEnabled(): boolean { return customLabelEnabled; }
```

**Output:**
```
export
function
IsCustomLabelEnabled
(
)
boolean
{
return
customLabelEnabled
}
```

---

**Input:**
```typescript
let customLabelEnabled: boolean = false;
```

**Output:**
```
let
customLabelEnabled
boolean
=
false
```

---

**Input:**
```typescript
const customLabelsEnabled: boolean | undefined = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration("workbench").get<boolean>("editor.customLabels.enabled");
```

**Output:**
```
const
customLabelsEnabled
boolean
|
undefined
=
vscode
workspace
getConfiguration
(
"workbench"
)
get
<
boolean
>
(
"editor.customLabels.enabled"
)
```

---

**Input:**
```typescript
if (customLabelsEnabled !== undefined) { customLabelEnabled = customLabelsEnabled; }
```

**Output:**
```
if
(
customLabelsEnabled
!==
undefined
)
{
customLabelEnabled
=
customLabelsEnabled
}
```

---

**Input:**
```typescript
customEditorLabelService = new CustomEditorLabelService(customLabelPatterns);
```

**Output:**
```
customEditorLabelService
=
new
CustomEditorLabelService
(
customLabelPatterns
)
```

---

**Input:**
```typescript
console.log(`Max Files: ${maxFiles}`);
```

**Output:**
```
console
log
(
`Max Files: 
${
maxFiles
}
`
)
```

# Notes

- Adapt for different programming languages and their syntax when identifying potential objects.
- Ensure that comments or unexpected non-code elements are excluded from the results.
- Each line in the output should aid in navigation within the code.

DO NOT EXPLAIN ANYTHING OR REPLY IN ANY OTHER WAY THAN OUTPUT LINES
